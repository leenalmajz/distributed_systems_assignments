**Authors:** Leen Al Majzoub, Botond Hernyes

## Introduction

This documentation describes the implementation of a secure and robust message queue system. 

This document is structured as follows:
- We first give a system-level overview.
- Then we outline dependencies and configuration requirements.
- Next, we describe the key modules and their responsibilities.
- We explain how modules interact.
- The API and usage instructions are then presented.
- Finally, we conclude with limitations and reflections.

## Overview of the system

This project implements a message queue system made for high performance computing (HPC) environments, specifically designed to support a machine learning prediction system. The service will allow authenticated agents and administrators to push messages transaction or prediction results into queues and pull them in a FIFO manner. Administrators will have exclusive rights to create and delete queues, with deletion removing all associated messages. The system will enforce a configurable maximum message limit per queue, periodically persist its state to storage for recovery on restart, and handle errors. A configuration file will control key operational parameters, and all client-server interactions will be logged comprehensively, including source, destination, headers, metadata, and message bodies.

We used **Flask** for its lightweight and modular design, and **PyYaml** to manage configuration easily. 

Testing was prioritized early in the development to ensure stability and fast feedback.

## Dependencies and Configuration 
### Required Packages

Install with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The application's configuration is loaded from a YAML file (default: `config.yaml`).  The configuration file should contain the following:

### Dependecies
* Flask: REST API framework
* PyYAML: For loading the YAML configuration

### Configuration File (config.yaml)
```yaml
QueueManager:
    path: "data/queues.json"
    max_length: 999
    save_period_time: 20
```
* 	`path`: File where the state of the queues is stored
*   `max_length`: Max number of messages per queue
*   `save_period_time`: Periodic save interval (in seconds)

## Module Descriptions

| File            | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `auth_mngr.py`  | Manages authentication and role-based token authorization (`ADMINISTRATOR`, `AGENT`, etc.). Handles token creation and validation. |
| `client.py`     | Simple test client for interacting with the API (used for early testing and debugging). |
| `config.py`     | Loads the YAML configuration file into the application. |
| `main.py`       | Entry point of the application. Initializes and links `AuthorizationManager` and `QueueManager`, and starts the Flask server. |
| `models.py`     | Defines structured data types like `Message`, `Transaction`, `Result`, and `User`, with methods to serialize/deserialize for persistence. |
| `queue_mngr.py` | Core logic for queue handling â€” includes methods for creation, deletion, pushing/pulling messages, and saving/loading from disk. Thread-safe and supports bounded queues. |
| `server.py`     | Defines all API endpoints, performs request authentication and routing, and integrates logging. Handles both administrative and user-level requests. |


## Module Interactions

*   `AuthorizationManager` is used by the API layer `server.py` to validate users before they perform queue operations.
*   `QueueManager` handles all queue-related operations, and is also initialized in `main.py`. It loads data from disk at startup and saves it periodically.
*   `models.py` is used by both `QueueManager` and the API layer to ensure messages conform to structure and can be persisted easily.
*   Logging is handled centrally in the Flask server, capturing all request metadata, headers, and bodies for auditing.
